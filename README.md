# pay_for_private_keys
Create contracts in Ethereum to atomically pay someone for a private key.

Details: http://roberts.pm/pay_for_private_keys

Todo list:
* Might want to make the code more flexible so that outside accounts can send ether to it and the code can reactively withdraw it for a correct solution. So multiple parties can participate. Use a withdraw pattern.
* Create a storage contract example.
* Create good docs for this. Update the current code.
* Refactor code so its less ugly and add better tests.
* Remove debug mode.
